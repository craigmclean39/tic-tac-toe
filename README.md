The Odin Project - Full Stack Javascript  - Tic Tac Toe Project

This Tic Tac Toe project was an exercise in object oriented programming.
I have encapsulated the game logic and the display logic in different modules.

Currently this is a single player game, the player vs. the AI. It utilizes the minimax algorithm and should be unbeatable.

I've used a few tools to generate gradients and animations.
Animista.net for animations.
Hypercolor.dev for gradients.
